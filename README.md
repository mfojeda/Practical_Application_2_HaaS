Practical Application Assignment 11.1: What Drives the Price of a Car?

In this exercise I analyzed what drives the price of an automobile giving the current dataset.

I used 3 different models: Ridge, Lasso and SFS Regressions. Each file and their version can be found in this repository. 

Link to my process and findings can be found in this Jupyter notebook: [Practical_Application2.ipynb](https://github.com/mfojeda/Practical_Application_2_HaaS/blob/ae2e62bd250f9c0b1f6f36d55c721e8b14abbcc7/Practical_Application2.ipynb)https://github.com/mfojeda/Practical_Application_2_HaaS/blob/ae2e62bd250f9c0b1f6f36d55c721e8b14abbcc7/Practical_Application2.ipynb
